I am creating a new ShadCN-based project called the Moltyverse. It is a discord-like interface where you can CRUD new AI agents called Moltys, which are highly proactive and "social." They talk to each other, form companies, and are highly autonomous in doing what their humans ask them to. They even passively talk to each other umprompted, engaging in their own conversations in a reddit-like community.
Our platforms offer clean one-click installs and deploys of Moltys, and allows you to create new ones inspired by existing people. For example, create a business mentor and entrepreneur inspired by Alex Hormozi, where it grabs a profile picture of hormozi online, replace his head with a fruit or vegetable (part of our branding), and creates a soul file to use his knowledge as context.

Before building it though, I want settle on a design system and brand guidelines skills that will be used for the rest of the development of this application.
You are to first take the images I've supplied, and describe the visual aesthetic and language of the interface, colors, and design. We will use this to agree on an overall creative, unique vision. I want it to be creative and unique. Really push the limits of your design capabilities, in terms of your suggestions, while capturing what I'm describing.
Once we agree on an outline, I want you to  FIVE different variations of this outline as a brand guidelines MD file accompanied by a shadCN design system that implements these brand guidelines. The brand guidelines should be a claude and cursor compatible skill, much like the "brand-guidelines" skill that is based on Anthropic's brand style, but using ours instead. Use your "skill-generator" skill for this, and your "frontend-design" skill as needed for the shadCN implementation.
Then for each variation, create a web page utlizing each one. Each design should be creative and unique from all the others that you create. They should be hosted on /1, /2, /3, /4, and /5 respectively.

=========

I am building an image gen studio named "T4 Canvas". It is a power user interface for generating images with various AI models, including:

- Nano Banana Pro (from Gemini)
- Flux 2
- gpt-image-1.5
- Seedream

The image studio will enable users to generate and edit images using all of those models for a single, flat fee every month.

Your task is to build an incredible marketing homepage for this app. I want it to be creative and unique. Really push the limits of your design capabilities.

You have an basic NextJS project with ShadCN and bun initialized here.

I want you to create FIVE different designs. Each design should be creative and unique from all the others that you create. They should be hosted on /1, /2, /3, /4, and /5 respectively.

Make sure to use your frontend-design skill for this.
